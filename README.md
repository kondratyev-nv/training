The alphabet system consists of `n` letters, denoted by the integers from `1` to `n`. Some letters can be transformed to other letters. A transformation is denoted by a pair of two letters, `x -> y`. Using this transformation, you can replace letter `x` with letter `y`. Transformations also have additional properties:
 - If letter `x` can be transformed to letter `y` using a transformation, then letter `y` can be transformed to letter `x` as well.
 - If letter `x` can be transformed to letter `y` and letter `y` can be transformed to letter `z`, then letter `x` can be transformed to letter `z` as well.
 
You are given a sequence `s` comprising of `m` letters. You are given `k` transformations that can be applied to `s`. You may apply transformations to zero or more letters in the sequence. When a transformation is applied to a letter, the other letters of the string remain unaffected. You can also apply a single transformation multiple times on the same sequence.

### Balanced Brackets - [Java](java/src/main/java/ru/nk/training/BalancedBracketsChecker.java)

[HackerRank - Balanced Brackets](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/balanced-brackets),
[LeetCode - Valid Parentheses](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-parentheses)

A bracket is considered to be any one of the following characters: `(`, `)`, `{`, `}`, `[`, or `]`. Two brackets are considered to be a matched pair if the an opening bracket (i.e., `(`, `[`, or `{`) occurs to the left of a closing bracket (i.e., `)`, `]`, or `}`) of the exact same type. There are three types of matched pairs of brackets: `[]`, `{}`, and `()`. A matching pair of brackets is not balanced if the set of brackets it encloses are not matched. For example, `{[(])}` is not balanced because the contents in between `{` and `}` are not balanced. The pair of square brackets encloses a single, unbalanced opening bracket, `(`, and the pair of parentheses encloses a single, unbalanced closing square bracket, `]`. By this logic, we say a sequence of brackets is considered to be balanced if the following conditions are met:
- It contains no unmatched brackets.
- The subset of brackets enclosed within the confines of a matched pair of brackets is also a matched pair of brackets.

Given  strings of brackets, determine whether each sequence of brackets is balanced.

### Highway Construction - [C++](cpp/include/highway_cost_calculator.hpp)

[HackerRank - Week of Code 35 - Highway Construction](https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/w35/challenges/highway-construction)

You are planning the next FIFA World Cup and you are counting the number of highways that need to be built to connect the cities with the venue. Your country has n cities and all cities lie on a single straight road called “Highway Road”. If you want to go from City `x` to City `y` (where `x` ≤ `y`), you need to go through city `x`, `x + 1`, `x + 2`, .., `y - 1`, `y`. The requirements for the highways are as follows:
 - All games will be held in the `n`-th city.
 - New bidirectional roads, called "Super Highways", need to be built such that it is possible to visit the `n`-th city from any other city directly. 

You also have the cost to fulfil the second condition. The engineering team knows that if the length of a Super Highway is `l`, then it will cost `l`<sup>`k`</sup>, where k is an integer constant. The length of Super Highway between city `x` and `y` is `|x - y|`. For this problem, you need to find only a rough estimation of the cost, hence, find Total Cost Modulo 1000000009.

### 3D Surface Area - [C++](cpp/src/surface_area.cpp)

[HackerRank - Week of Code 35 - 3D Surface Area](https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/w35/challenges/3d-surface-area)

A relay race is being organised in a school for middle school students by two high school students, Mason and Madison. Mason starts with the baton and Madison receives the baton at the final destination. There are middle school students in between Mason and Madison, and each of their heights is given. Mason's height, too, is given. Initially, the baton is with Mason and it is passed to the destination in a manner similar to a relay race.
 
1. At any moment,the current baton carrier has an option to hand over the baton to the student at the current position or to continue to the next position. However, if the student at the given position is taller than the current baton carrier, it is mandatory to hand over the baton because it is a safer option according to Mason.
1. It takes one second to move between consecutive positions.
1. Whenever the baton is handed over , there is a time and price associated with it.
1. The time taken, in seconds, is the absolute difference between the heights of the current baton carrier and the student to whom the baton is handed.
1. The student to whom the baton is passed charges a given price.
 
Note: Price charged can be negative too.
 
The baton must be sent to Madison in the minimum possible sum of time and price. Complete the function Solve which takes the number of middle school students, Mason's height, and heights and prices charged by middle school students as input, and return the minimum possible sum of time and price required for the baton to reach Madison.

### Permuting Two Arrays - [C++](cpp/src/can_permute_for_sum.cpp)

[HackerRank - Permuting Two Arrays](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/two-arrays)

Consider two `n`-element arrays of integers, `A` and `B`. You want to permute them into some `A'` and `B'` such that the relation `a_i' + b_i' >= k` holds for all `i` where `0 <= i < n`. For example, if `A = [0, 1]`, `B = [0, 2]`, and `k = 1`, a valid `A'`, `B'` satisfying our relation would be `A' = [1 , 0]` and `B' = [0, 2]`.

Print `YES` if some permutations `A'` and `B'`, exist satisfying the relation above. If no valid permutations exist, print `NO` instead.

### Unbounded knapsack - [Python](python/src/unbounded_knapsack.py)

[HackerRank - Knapsack](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/unbounded-knapsack),
[GeeksforGeeks - Unbounded Knapsack (Repetition of items allowed)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/unbounded-knapsack-repetition-items-allowed)

Given a knapsack weight `W` and a set of `n` items with certain value `val`<sub>`i`</sub> and weight `wt`<sub>`i`</sub>, we need to calculate minimum amount that could make up this quantity exactly. This is different from classical Knapsack problem, here we are allowed to use unlimited number of instances of an item.

### Journey to the Moon - [Python](python/src/count_possible_astronaut_pairs.py)

[HackerRank - Journey to the Moon](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/journey-to-the-moon)

The member states of the UN are planning to send two people to the Moon. But there is a problem. In line with their principles of global unity, they want to pair astronauts of two different countries. There are `N` trained astronauts numbered from `0` to `N - 1`. But those in charge of the mission did not receive information about the citizenship of each astronaut. The only information they have is that some particular pairs of astronauts belong to the same country. Your task is to compute in how many ways they can pick a pair of astronauts belonging to different countries. Assume that you are provided enough pairs to let you identify the groups of astronauts even though you might not know their country directly. For instance, if `1`, `2`, `3` are astronauts from the same country; it is sufficient to mention that `(1, 2)` and `(2, 3)` are pairs of astronauts from the same country without providing information about a third pair `(1, 3)`.

### Sum of subnumbers - [Python](python/src/subnumbers_sum.py)

[HackerRank - Sam and sub-strings](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/sam-and-substrings)

Samantha and Sam are playing a game. They have `N` balls in front of them, each ball numbered from `0` to `9`, except the first ball which is numbered from `1` to `9`. Samantha calculates all the sub-strings of the number thus formed, one by one. If the sub-string is `S`, Sam has to throw S candies into an initially empty box. At the end of the game, Sam has to find out the total number of candies in the box, `T`. As `T` can be large, Samantha asks Sam to tell `T % (10^9+7)` instead. If Sam answers correctly, he can keep all the candies. Sam can't take all this Maths and asks for your help.

### Ice Cream Parlor - [C++](cpp/src/find_pair_by_sum.cpp)

[HackerRank - Hash Tables: Ice Cream Parlor](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/ctci-ice-cream-parlor)

Each time Sunny and Johnny take a trip to the Ice Cream Parlor, they pool together `m` dollars for ice cream. On any given day, the parlor offers a line of `n` flavors. Each flavor, `i`, is numbered sequentially with a unique ID number from `1` to `n` and has a cost, `cost`<sub>`i`</sub>, associated with it.

Given the value of `m` and the cost of each flavor for `t` trips to the Ice Cream Parlor, help Sunny and Johnny choose two distinct flavors such that they spend their entire pool of money during each visit. For each trip to the parlor, print the ID numbers for the two types of ice cream that Sunny and Johnny purchase as two space-separated integers on a new line. You must print the smaller ID first and the larger ID second.

Note: Two ice creams having unique IDs `i` and `j` may have the same cost (i.e., `cost`<sub>`i`</sub> == `cost`<sub>`j`</sub>).

### Sort huge numbers - [C++](cpp/src/sort_huge_numbers.cpp)

[HackerRank - Big Sorting](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/big-sorting)

Consider an array of numeric strings, `unsorted`, where each string is a positive number with anywhere from 1 to 10<sup>6</sup> digits. Sort the array's elements in non-decreasing (i.e., ascending) order of their real-world integer values and print each element of the sorted array on a new line.

### Is abbreviation - [C++](cpp/src/is_abbreviation.cpp)

[HackerRank - Abbreviation](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/abbr)

You can perform the following operation on some string, `a`:
- Capitalize zero or more of `a`'s lowercase letters at some index `i` (i.e., make them uppercase).
- Delete all of the remaining lowercase letters in `a`.

Given `q` queries in the form of two strings, `a` and `b`, determine if it's possible to make `a` equal to `b` by performing the above operation on `a`. If `a` can be transformed into `b`, print `YES` on a new line; otherwise, print `NO`.

### Majority Element - [Python](python/src/find_majority_element.py)

Given a sequence of elements `a`<sub>`1`</sub>, `a`<sub>`2`</sub>, ... , `a`<sub>`n`</sub>, you would like to check whether it contains an element (majority element) that appears more than `n`/2 times. 

### Organizing a Lottery - [Python](python/src/count_segments_for_points.py)

You are organizing an online lottery. To participate, a person bets on a single integer. You then draw several ranges of consecutive integers at random. A participant’s payoff then is proportional to the number of ranges that contain the participant’s number minus the number of ranges that does not contain it. You need an efficient algorithm for computing the payoffs for all participants.

You are given a set of points on a line and a set of segments on a line. The goal is to compute, for each point, the number of segments that contain this point.
