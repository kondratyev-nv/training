## How to build

### Java

Java 8 and Maven are required. To build and run tests

    cd java
    mvn clean test

### Python

Python 3.5 is required. To run tests

    cd python
    python -m unittest discover -v --pattern *_tests.py

To run tests with coverage 

    coverage run --source=src -m unittest discover -v --pattern *_tests.py

To run tests in VSCode [Python extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python) can be used.

### C++

To build from VSCode open cpp directory (`code cpp`) and run build task. To run tests after build execute test task.

#### Linux

On Linux gcc-5 and g++-5 and CMake 3.2 are required. To build and run tests from the console go to the cpp directory (`cd ./cpp/`) and run `./build.sh` or 

    mkdir -p build
    cd build
    cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -G "Unix Makefiles" ..
    cmake --build .
    ctest -VV

To build and run tests with coverage use `./build_with_coverage.sh`. You will need lcov installed for this.

#### Windows

MinGW 6.3.0 (with packages mingw-developer-toolkit, mingw32-base, mingw32-gcc-g++, msys-base and mingw32-pthreads-w32) and CMake 3.2 are required. Pathes to the CMake and MinGW binaries should be in your PATH variable. Also for VSCode IntelliSense to work environment variable MINGW_PATH need to be specified and should point to MinGW installation directory (C:\\MinGW by default). To build and run tests from the command line go to the cpp directory (`cd .\cpp`) and run `.\build.bat` or

    if not exist build mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -G "Unix Makefiles" ..

The alphabet system consists of `n` letters, denoted by the integers from `1` to `n`. Some letters can be transformed to other letters. A transformation is denoted by a pair of two letters, `x -> y`. Using this transformation, you can replace letter `x` with letter `y`. Transformations also have additional properties:
 - If letter `x` can be transformed to letter `y` using a transformation, then letter `y` can be transformed to letter `x` as well.
 - If letter `x` can be transformed to letter `y` and letter `y` can be transformed to letter `z`, then letter `x` can be transformed to letter `z` as well.
 
You are given a sequence `s` comprising of `m` letters. You are given `k` transformations that can be applied to `s`. You may apply transformations to zero or more letters in the sequence. When a transformation is applied to a letter, the other letters of the string remain unaffected. You can also apply a single transformation multiple times on the same sequence.

### Balanced Brackets - [Java](java/src/main/java/ru/nk/training/BalancedBracketsChecker.java)

[HackerRank - Balanced Brackets](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/balanced-brackets),
[LeetCode - Valid Parentheses](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-parentheses)

A bracket is considered to be any one of the following characters: `(`, `)`, `{`, `}`, `[`, or `]`. Two brackets are considered to be a matched pair if the an opening bracket (i.e., `(`, `[`, or `{`) occurs to the left of a closing bracket (i.e., `)`, `]`, or `}`) of the exact same type. There are three types of matched pairs of brackets: `[]`, `{}`, and `()`. A matching pair of brackets is not balanced if the set of brackets it encloses are not matched. For example, `{[(])}` is not balanced because the contents in between `{` and `}` are not balanced. The pair of square brackets encloses a single, unbalanced opening bracket, `(`, and the pair of parentheses encloses a single, unbalanced closing square bracket, `]`. By this logic, we say a sequence of brackets is considered to be balanced if the following conditions are met:
- It contains no unmatched brackets.
- The subset of brackets enclosed within the confines of a matched pair of brackets is also a matched pair of brackets.

Given  strings of brackets, determine whether each sequence of brackets is balanced.

### Highway Construction - [C++](cpp/include/highway_cost_calculator.hpp)

[HackerRank - Week of Code 35 - Highway Construction](https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/w35/challenges/highway-construction)

You are planning the next FIFA World Cup and you are counting the number of highways that need to be built to connect the cities with the venue. Your country has n cities and all cities lie on a single straight road called “Highway Road”. If you want to go from City `x` to City `y` (where `x` ≤ `y`), you need to go through city `x`, `x + 1`, `x + 2`, .., `y - 1`, `y`. The requirements for the highways are as follows:
 - All games will be held in the `n`-th city.
 - New bidirectional roads, called "Super Highways", need to be built such that it is possible to visit the `n`-th city from any other city directly. 

You also have the cost to fulfil the second condition. The engineering team knows that if the length of a Super Highway is `l`, then it will cost `l`<sup>`k`</sup>, where k is an integer constant. The length of Super Highway between city `x` and `y` is `|x - y|`. For this problem, you need to find only a rough estimation of the cost, hence, find Total Cost Modulo 1000000009.

### 3D Surface Area - [C++](cpp/src/surface_area.cpp)

A relay race is being organised in a school for middle school students by two high school students, Mason and Madison. Mason starts with the baton and Madison receives the baton at the final destination. There are middle school students in between Mason and Madison, and each of their heights is given. Mason's height, too, is given. Initially, the baton is with Mason and it is passed to the destination in a manner similar to a relay race.
 
1. At any moment,the current baton carrier has an option to hand over the baton to the student at the current position or to continue to the next position. However, if the student at the given position is taller than the current baton carrier, it is mandatory to hand over the baton because it is a safer option according to Mason.
1. It takes one second to move between consecutive positions.
1. Whenever the baton is handed over , there is a time and price associated with it.
1. The time taken, in seconds, is the absolute difference between the heights of the current baton carrier and the student to whom the baton is handed.
1. The student to whom the baton is passed charges a given price.
 
Note: Price charged can be negative too.
 
The baton must be sent to Madison in the minimum possible sum of time and price. Complete the function Solve which takes the number of middle school students, Mason's height, and heights and prices charged by middle school students as input, and return the minimum possible sum of time and price required for the baton to reach Madison.

For example, if `A = [0, 1]`, `B = [0, 2]`, and `k = 1`, a valid `A'`, `B'` satisfying our relation would be `A' = [1 , 0]` and `B' = [0, 2]`.

Print `YES` if some permutations `A'` and `B'`, exist satisfying the relation above. If no valid permutations exist, print `NO` instead.

### Unbounded knapsack - [Python](python/src/unbounded_knapsack.py)

[HackerRank - Knapsack](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/unbounded-knapsack),
[GeeksforGeeks - Unbounded Knapsack (Repetition of items allowed)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/unbounded-knapsack-repetition-items-allowed)

Given a knapsack weight `W` and a set of `n` items with certain value `val`<sub>`i`</sub> and weight `wt`<sub>`i`</sub>, we need to calculate minimum amount that could make up this quantity exactly. This is different from classical Knapsack problem, here we are allowed to use unlimited number of instances of an item.

### Journey to the Moon - [Python](python/src/count_possible_astronaut_pairs.py)

[HackerRank - Journey to the Moon](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/journey-to-the-moon)

The member states of the UN are planning to send two people to the Moon. But there is a problem. In line with their principles of global unity, they want to pair astronauts of two different countries. There are `N` trained astronauts numbered from `0` to `N - 1`. But those in charge of the mission did not receive information about the citizenship of each astronaut. The only information they have is that some particular pairs of astronauts belong to the same country. Your task is to compute in how many ways they can pick a pair of astronauts belonging to different countries. Assume that you are provided enough pairs to let you identify the groups of astronauts even though you might not know their country directly. For instance, if `1`, `2`, `3` are astronauts from the same country; it is sufficient to mention that `(1, 2)` and `(2, 3)` are pairs of astronauts from the same country without providing information about a third pair `(1, 3)`.

### Sum of subnumbers - [Python](python/src/subnumbers_sum.py)

[HackerRank - Sam and sub-strings](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/sam-and-substrings)

Samantha and Sam are playing a game. They have `N` balls in front of them, each ball numbered from `0` to `9`, except the first ball which is numbered from `1` to `9`. Samantha calculates all the sub-strings of the number thus formed, one by one. If the sub-string is `S`, Sam has to throw S candies into an initially empty box. At the end of the game, Sam has to find out the total number of candies in the box, `T`. As `T` can be large, Samantha asks Sam to tell `T % (10^9+7)` instead. If Sam answers correctly, he can keep all the candies. Sam can't take all this Maths and asks for your help.

### Ice Cream Parlor - [C++](cpp/src/find_pair_by_sum.cpp)

[HackerRank - Hash Tables: Ice Cream Parlor](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/ctci-ice-cream-parlor)

Each time Sunny and Johnny take a trip to the Ice Cream Parlor, they pool together `m` dollars for ice cream. On any given day, the parlor offers a line of `n` flavors. Each flavor, `i`, is numbered sequentially with a unique ID number from `1` to `n` and has a cost, `cost`<sub>`i`</sub>, associated with it.

Given the value of `m` and the cost of each flavor for `t` trips to the Ice Cream Parlor, help Sunny and Johnny choose two distinct flavors such that they spend their entire pool of money during each visit. For each trip to the parlor, print the ID numbers for the two types of ice cream that Sunny and Johnny purchase as two space-separated integers on a new line. You must print the smaller ID first and the larger ID second.

Note: Two ice creams having unique IDs `i` and `j` may have the same cost (i.e., `cost`<sub>`i`</sub> == `cost`<sub>`j`</sub>).

### Sort huge numbers - [C++](cpp/src/sort_huge_numbers.cpp)

[HackerRank - Big Sorting](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/big-sorting)

Consider an array of numeric strings, `unsorted`, where each string is a positive number with anywhere from 1 to 10<sup>6</sup> digits. Sort the array's elements in non-decreasing (i.e., ascending) order of their real-world integer values and print each element of the sorted array on a new line.

### Is abbreviation - [C++](cpp/src/is_abbreviation.cpp)

[HackerRank - Abbreviation](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/abbr)

You can perform the following operation on some string, `a`:
- Capitalize zero or more of `a`'s lowercase letters at some index `i` (i.e., make them uppercase).
- Delete all of the remaining lowercase letters in `a`.

Given `q` queries in the form of two strings, `a` and `b`, determine if it's possible to make `a` equal to `b` by performing the above operation on `a`. If `a` can be transformed into `b`, print `YES` on a new line; otherwise, print `NO`.

### Maximize loot - [C++](cpp/src/maximize_loot.cpp)

A thief finds much more loot than his bag can fit. Help him to find the most valuable combination of items assuming that any fraction of a loot item can be put into his bag. The goal of this code problem is to implement an algorithm for the fractional knapsack problem. The first line of the input contains the number `n` of items and the capacity `W` of a knapsack. The next `n` lines define the values and weights of the items. The `i`-th line contains integers `v`<sub>`i`</sub> and `w`<sub>`i`</sub> — the value and the weight of `i`-th item, respectively.

### Maximum advertisement revenue - [C++](cpp/src/maximum_advertisement_revenue.cpp)

Given two sequences `a`<sub>`1`</sub>, `a`<sub>`2`</sub>, ..., `a`<sub>`n`</sub> (`a`<sub>`i`</sub> is the profit per click of the `i`-th ad) and `b`<sub>`1`</sub>, `b`<sub>`2`</sub>, ..., `b`<sub>`n`</sub> (`b`<sub>`i`</sub> is the average number of clicks per day of the `i`-th slot), we need to partition them into `n` pairs (`a`<sub>`i`</sub>, `b`<sub>`j`</sub>) such that the sum of their products is maximized.

### Maximum number of prizes - [C++](cpp/src/maximum_number_of_prizes.cpp)

The goal of this problem is to represent a given positive integer `n` as a sum of as many pairwise distinct positive integers as possible. That is, to find the maximum `k` such that `n` can be written as `a`<sub>`1`</sub> + `a`<sub>`2`</sub> + ..., + `a`<sub>`k`</sub> where `a`<sub>`1`</sub>, ..., `a`<sub>`k`</sub> are positive integers and `a`<sub>`i`</sub> != `a`<sub>`j`</sub> for all 1 ≤ `i` < `j` ≤ `k`.

### Has negative cycle - [Python](python/src/has_negative_cycle.py)

Given an directed graph with possibly negative edge weights and with `n` vertices and `m` edges, check whether it contains a cycle of negative weight.

### Is bipartite - [Python](python/src/is_bipartite.py)

Given an undirected graph with `n` vertices and `m` edges, check whether it is bipartite. An undirected graph is called bipartite if its vertices can be split into two parts such that each edge of the graph joins to vertices from different parts. Bipartite graphs arise naturally in applications where a graph is used to model connections between objects of two different types (say, boys and girls; or students and dormitories).

### Connected components - [Python](python/src/vertices_to_components.py)

Given an undirected graph with `n` vertices and `m` edges, compute the number of connected components in it.

### Topological sort - [Python](python/src/topological_sort.py)

Compute a topological ordering of a given directed acyclic graph (DAG) with `n` vertices and `m` edges.

### Convert array into heap - [C++](cpp/include/heapify.hpp)

The first step of the HeapSort algorithm is to create a heap from the array you want to sort. Your task is to implement this first step and convert a given array of integers into a heap. You will do that by applying a certain number of swaps to the array. Swap is an operation which exchanges elements a `i` and a `j` of the array a for some `i` and `j`. You will need to convert the array into a heap using only O(n) swaps, as was described in the lectures. Note that you will need to use a min-heap instead of a max-heap in this problem.

### Parallel processing - [Python](python/src/parallel_processing.py)

You have a program which is parallelized and uses `n` independent threads to process the given list of `m` jobs. Threads take jobs in the order they are given in the input. If there is a free thread, it immediately takes the next job from the list. If a thread has started processing a job, it doesn’t interrupt or stop until it finishes processing the job. If several threads try to take jobs from the list simultaneously, the thread with smaller index takes the job. For each job you know exactly how long will it take any thread to process this job, and this time is the same for all the threads. You need to determine for each job which thread will process it and when will it start processing.

### Counting Inversions - [C++](cpp/src/sort_with_invertions_counting.cpp)

[HackerRank - Merge Sort: Counting Inversions](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/ctci-merge-sort),
[GeeksforGeeks - Count Inversions in an array](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/counting-inversions)

In an array, `arr`, the elements at indices `i` and `j` (where `i` < `j`) form an inversion if `arr`<sub>`i`</sub> > `arr`<sub>`j`</sub>. In other words, inverted elements `arr`<sub>`i`</sub> and `arr`<sub>`j`</sub> are considered to be "out of order". To correct an inversion, we can swap adjacent elements.

For example, consider `arr = [2, 4, 1]`. It has two inversions: (2, 1) and (4, 1). To sort the array, we must perform the following two swaps to correct the inversions: swap(`arr`<sub>`1`</sub>, `arr`<sub>`2`</sub>) and swap(`arr`<sub>`0`</sub>, `arr`<sub>`1`</sub>)

Print the number of inversions that must be swapped to sort an array on a new line.

Given a sequence of elements `a`<sub>`1`</sub>, `a`<sub>`2`</sub>, ... , `a`<sub>`n`</sub>, you would like to check whether it contains an element (majority element) that appears more than `n`/2 times. 

### Organizing a Lottery - [Python](python/src/count_segments_for_points.py)

You are organizing an online lottery. To participate, a person bets on a single integer. You then draw several ranges of consecutive integers at random. A participant’s payoff then is proportional to the number of ranges that contain the participant’s number minus the number of ranges that does not contain it. You need an efficient algorithm for computing the payoffs for all participants.

You are given a set of points on a line and a set of segments on a line. The goal is to compute, for each point, the number of segments that contain this point.

### Longest common subsequence - [C++](cpp/src/longest_common_subsequence.cpp)

Given two or three sequences of integers, find the longest common subsequence and print it as a line of space-separated integers. If there are multiple common subsequences with the same maximum length, print any one of them.

You are given a primitive calculator that can perform the following three operations with the current number `x`: multiply `x` by 2, multiply `x` by 3, or add 1 to `x`. Your goal is given a positive integer `n`, find the minimum number of operations needed to obtain the number `n` starting from the number 1.

### Frequency Queries - [C++](cpp/src/frequency_queries.cpp)

[HackerRank - Frequency Queries](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/frequency-queries)

You are given queries. Each query is one of the described below:
 - Insert x in your data structure.
 - Delete one occurence of y from your data structure, if present.
 - Check if any integer is present whose frequency is exactly z. If yes, print 1 else 0.

For example, you are given a list of operations. The results of each operation are: 

    Operation      Array       Output
    (ADD, 1)       [1]
    (DEL, 2)       [1]
    (GET, 2)                   0
    (ADD, 1)       [1,1]
    (ADD, 1)       [1,1,1]
    (DEL, 1)       [1,1]
    (GET, 2)                   1

### Friend Circle Queries - [Python](python/src/disjoint_set.py)

[HackerRank - Friend Circle Queries](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/friend-circle-queries)

The population of HackerWorld is 10^9. Initially, none of the people  are friends with each other. In order to start a friendship, two persons  a and b have to shake hands, where 1 <= a, b <= 10^9. The friendship relation is transitive, that is if a and b shake hands with each other, a and friends of q become friends with b and friends of b.

You will be given q queries. After each query, you need to report the size of the largest friend circle (the largest group of friends) formed after considering that query.

For example, your list of queries is:

    1 2
    3 4
    2 3

First, 1 and 2 shake hands, forming a circle of 2. Next, 3 and 4 do the same. Now there are two groups of 2 friends. When 2 and 3 become friends in the next query, both groups of friends are added together to make a circle of 4 friends. We would print

    2
    2
    4

### Merge Overlapping Intervals - [Python](python/src/merge_intersecting_segments.py)

Given a set of intervals in any order, merge all overlapping intervals into one and output the result which should have only mutually exclusive intervals. Let the intervals be represented as pairs of integers for simplicity. For example, let the given set of intervals be [ {1, 3}, {2, 4}, {5, 7}, {6, 8} ]. The intervals {1, 3} and {2, 4} overlap with each other, so they should be merged and become {1, 4}. Similarly {5, 7} and {6, 8} should be merged and become {5, 8}.

### Find subarray with a specified sum - [C++](cpp/src/find_subarray_with_sum.cpp)

Given an array `A` of non-negative numbers find a contiguous subarray elements of which sums up to a value `X`.

### Running Median - [C++](cpp/include/running_median.hpp)

[HackerRank - Find the Running Median](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/find-the-running-median)

The median of a set of integers is the midpoint value of the data set for which an equal number of integers are less than and greater than the value. To find the median, you must first sort your set of integers in non-decreasing order, then:
 - If your set contains an odd number of elements, the median is the middle element of the sorted sample. In the sorted set {1, 2, 3}, 2 is the median.
 - If your set contains an even number of elements, the median is the average of the two middle elements of the sorted sample. In the sorted set {1, 2, 3, 4}, (2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5 is the median.
 
 Given an input stream of n integers, you must perform the following task for each i-th integer:
 - Add the i-th integer to a running list of integers.
 - Find the median of the updated list (i.e., for the first element through the i-th element).
 - Print the list's updated median on a new line. The printed value must be a double-precision number scaled to 1 decimal place (i.e., 12.3 format).

### Number coloring - [Python](python/src/number_coloring.py)

There is a sequence of integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an. You need to color the elements of the sequence so that for an arbitrary color, all elements of this color should be divisible by the minimal element of this color. You need to minimize the number of colors used.

For example, you can color elements [40, 10, 60] in one color, because all of them are divisable by 10. Every color can be used any number of times (including using any color exactly once). Elements of the same color are not obliged to be adjacent.

For example, if a=[6, 2, 3, 4, 12], then you need to use two colors: 6,3,12 can be colored in the first color (6,3,12 are divisable by 3), and 2 and 4 in the second color (2 and 4 are divisable by 2). For example, if a=[10, 7, 15], then you need 3 colors (each element should be colored in different color).

**Input:** First row contains one integer n (1<=n<=100), where n is the lenght of the sequence. Second row contains n integers a1,a2,...,an (1<=ai<=100). Numbers in the sequence can be repeated.

**Output:** Print the minimal number of colors needed to color the elements correctly.
