For example, given the string “hat”, your function should print the strings “tha”, “aht”, “tah”, “ath”, “hta”, and “hat”. Treat each character in the input string as a distinct character, even if it is repeated. Given the string “aaa”, your routine should print “aaa” six times. You may print the permutations in any order you choose.

Write a function that takes a pointer to the head of a list and determines whether the list is cyclic or acyclic. Your function should return false if the list is acyclic and true if it is cyclic. You may not modify the list in any way.

### Integer/String Conversions - [Java](java/src/main/java/ru/nk/training/IntegerStringConverter.java)

Write two conversion routines. The first routine converts a string to a signed integer. You may assume that the string contains only digits and the minus character ('-'), that it is a properly formatted integer number, and that the number is within the range of an int type. The second routine converts a signed integer stored as an int back to a string.

### Add one to big integer - [Python](python/src/add_one_to_big_integer.py)

Given a non-negative integer represented as a non-empty array of digits, plus one to the integer. You may assume the integer do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself. The digits are stored such that the most significant digit is at the head of the list.

### Count patterns - [Python](python/src/count_patterns.py)

A string `s` contains many patterns of the form `1(0+)1` where `(0+)` represents any non-empty consecutive sequence of zeros. The patterns are allowed to overlap. For example, consider string `1101001`, we can see there are two consecutive sequences `1(0)1` and `1(00)1` which are of the form `1(0+)1`. Find the total number of patterns of the form `1(0+)1` that occur in `s`.

### Find longest palindromic subsequence - [Java](java/src/main/java/ru/nk/training/LongestPalindromicSubsequenceFinder.java)

Given a string, find a longest palindromic subsequence in it. A longest palindromic subsequence is a sequence that appears in the same relative order, but not necessarily contiguous (not substring) and palindrome in nature (means the subsequence will read same from the front and back).

### Given a string find out if symbols can be rearranged to a palindrom - [Python](python/src/can_rearrange_to_palindrom.py)

Given a string find out if symbols can be rearranged to a palindrom.

### Find longest palindromic subsequence that can be obtained with specific transformations - [Java](java/src/main/java/ru/nk/training/LongestPalindromicSubsequenceWithTransformationFinder.java)

The alphabet system consists of `n` letters, denoted by the integers from `1` to `n`. Some letters can be transformed to other letters. A transformation is denoted by a pair of two letters, `x -> y`. Using this transformation, you can replace letter `x` with letter `y`. Transformations also have additional properties:
 - If letter `x` can be transformed to letter `y` using a transformation, then letter `y` can be transformed to letter `x` as well.
 - If letter `x` can be transformed to letter `y` and letter `y` can be transformed to letter `z`, then letter `x` can be transformed to letter `z` as well.
 
You are given a sequence `s` comprising of `m` letters. You are given `k` transformations that can be applied to `s`. You may apply transformations to zero or more letters in the sequence. When a transformation is applied to a letter, the other letters of the string remain unaffected. You can also apply a single transformation multiple times on the same sequence. Find the length of the longest possible palindromic subsequence after applying zero or more transformations on the letters of the given sequence.

### Word Break - [Java](java/src/main/java/ru/nk/training/StringByWordsSplitter.java)

Given a non-empty string `s` and a dictionary of words containing non-empty words, determine if `s` can be segmented into a space-separated sequence of one or more dictionary words. You may assume the dictionary does not contain duplicate words. For example, given `s = "leetcode"`, `dict = ["leet", "code"]` return space separated sentence `"leet code"`.

### Find number of available positions in matrix - [Java](java/src/main/java/ru/nk/training/MatrixAvailablePositionsCounter.java)

You are given `n x m` matrix and a list of tracks that always run in straight horizontal lines along a row. In other words, the start and end points of a track are `(r, c1)` and `(r, c2)`, where `r` represents the row number, `c1` represents the starting column, and `c2` represents the ending column of the track. Determine the number of cell that is not occupied by a track.

### Recursive Digit Sum - [Python](python/src/get_recursive_digit_sum.py)

We define super digit of an integer `x` using the following rules:
- If `x` has only 1 digit, then its super digit is `x`.
- Otherwise, the super digit of `x` is equal to the super digit of the digit-sum of `x`. Here, digit-sum of a number is defined as the sum of its digits.

You are given two numbers `n` and `k`. You have to calculate the super digit of `P`. `P` is created when number `n` is concatenated `k` times.

### Find Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) - [Python](python/src/minimum_spanning_tree.py)

Given a graph which consists of several edges connecting the N nodes in it. It is required to find a subgraph of the given graph with the following properties:
- The subgraph contains all the nodes present in the original graph.
- The subgraph is of minimum overall weight (sum of all edges) among all such subgraphs.
- It is also required that there is exactly one, exclusive path between any two nodes of the subgraph.

### Min Stack - [Java](java/src/main/java/ru/nk/training/MinStack.java)

Design a stack that supports push, pop, top, and retrieving the minimum element in constant time.
- `push(x)` - Push element x onto stack.
- `pop()` - Removes the element on top of the stack.
- `peek()` - Get the top element.
- `getMin()` - Retrieve the minimum element in the stack.

### Balanced Brackets - [Java](java/src/main/java/ru/nk/training/BalancedBracketsChecker.java)

A bracket is considered to be any one of the following characters: `(`, `)`, `{`, `}`, `[`, or `]`. Two brackets are considered to be a matched pair if the an opening bracket (i.e., `(`, `[`, or `{`) occurs to the left of a closing bracket (i.e., `)`, `]`, or `}`) of the exact same type. There are three types of matched pairs of brackets: `[]`, `{}`, and `()`. A matching pair of brackets is not balanced if the set of brackets it encloses are not matched. For example, `{[(])}` is not balanced because the contents in between `{` and `}` are not balanced. The pair of square brackets encloses a single, unbalanced opening bracket, `(`, and the pair of parentheses encloses a single, unbalanced closing square bracket, `]`. By this logic, we say a sequence of brackets is considered to be balanced if the following conditions are met:
- It contains no unmatched brackets.
- The subset of brackets enclosed within the confines of a matched pair of brackets is also a matched pair of brackets.

Given  strings of brackets, determine whether each sequence of brackets is balanced.

### Is This a Binary Search Tree? - [Java](java/src/main/java/ru/nk/training/BinarySearchTreeChecker.java)

Given the root node of a binary tree, can you determine if it's also a binary search tree. A binary tree is a binary search tree when the following ordering requirements are satisfied:
- The value of every node in a node's left subtree is less than the data value of that node.
- The value of every node in a node's right subtree is greater than the data value of that node.

### Average of Fibonacci numbers - [Java](java/src/main/java/ru/nk/training/AverageOfFibonacciNumbersFinder.java)

### Highway Construction - [C++](cpp/include/highway_cost_calculator.hpp)

You are planning the next FIFA World Cup and you are counting the number of highways that need to be built to connect the cities with the venue. Your country has n cities and all cities lie on a single straight road called “Highway Road”. If you want to go from City `x` to City `y` (where `x` ≤ `y`), you need to go through city `x`, `x + 1`, `x + 2`, .., `y - 1`, `y`. The requirements for the highways are as follows:
 - All games will be held in the `n`-th city.
 - New bidirectional roads, called "Super Highways", need to be built such that it is possible to visit the `n`-th city from any other city directly. 

You also have the cost to fulfil the second condition. The engineering team knows that if the length of a Super Highway is `l`, then it will cost `l`<sup>`k`</sup>, where k is an integer constant. The length of Super Highway between city `x` and `y` is `|x - y|`. For this problem, you need to find only a rough estimation of the cost, hence, find Total Cost Modulo 1000000009.

### 3D Surface Area - [C++](cpp/src/surface_area.cpp)

Madison, is a little girl who is fond of toys. Her friend Mason works in a toy manufacturing factory. Mason has a 2D board A of size `H` x `W` with `H` rows and `W` columns. The board is divided into cells of size 1 x 1 with each cell indicated by it's coordinate `(i, j)`. The cell `(i, j)` has an integer `A`<sub>`ij`</sub> written on it. To create the toy Mason stacks `A`<sub>`ij`</sub> number of cubes of size 1 x 1 x 1 on the cell `(i, j)`. Given the description of the board showing the values of `A`<sub>`ij`</sub> and that the price of the toy is equal to the 3D surface area find the price of the toy.

### Flatten Binary Tree - [Java](java/src/main/java/ru/nk/training/BinaryTreeFlattener.java)
